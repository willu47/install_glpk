# Windows users:

After installing LEAP, the only remaining task is to add the directory to the GLPK solver to the PATH environment variable.

This is in Control Panel | System Settings | Advanced Settings | Environment Variables | PATH

Open the PATH variable, and add the installation directory which should look like this `C:/Program Files(x86)/LEAP/w64/`

# Mac users:

After running the install package, you need to add an entry to the PATH variable which allows you to run `glpsol` (the GLPK solver) from any directory.

Without doing this command, you would need to enter the entire installation directory path every time you run `glpsol`, which is rather tedious.
